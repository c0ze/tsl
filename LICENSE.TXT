TSL is not free software. For several reasons I have not placed it
under any conventional open source license. I might do so in the
future, but for now the following shall apply:

The source code is provided so you can compile it on any architecture
and verify what runs inside your computer.

You may distribute unmodified copies of the source package.

I don't really mind unofficial patches or ports, but I prefer if you
contact me first.

You are not allowed to sell TSL in any form (source code or binaries).

TSL comes with no warranty. Use it at your own risk.
